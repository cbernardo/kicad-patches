WISHLIST for KiCad - tasks are in order of priority
In some cases delays on a high priority item may
permit lower priority items to be finished first.
===================================================

1. DXF lib: if possible, remove the DXF lib source code from within KiCad.
   The trick is in (1) identifying the headers and library at build time and
   (2) ensuring that the library can be installed on platforms such as
   MSWin and OSX without incurring a big penalty (such as a full installation
   of LibreCAD).


2. Work on dynamic PLUGIN scheme for exporters
    Includes implementation and documentation plus
    conversion of at least one exporter.


3. 3D model integration:
	a. 3D viewer:
		+ add ability to convert STEP/IGES on the fly;
			conversion *only* supported at request of user.
			For example, a usr may have VRML and STEP models
			but only wishes to render the VRML models in 3DViewer
		+ add ability to convert IDF on the fly; as with STEP/IGES,
			only at the user's request

    b. VRML Exporter:
		+ add abilitity to convert STEP/IGES/IDF as requested by user
		+ add option to remove all board items beyond the board
			outline such as floating PTH and silkscreen.
		+ make the edge plated holes look right; this is tricky
			in the current render code

    c.  Put some sort of persistence into the VRML/X3D/IDF file selector;
        it is rather annoying to have to select the 'IDF' file each time
        an IDF file is being specified. If the user specifies one IDF
        file,  odds are they're only setting IDF files at this time and not
        VRML files. In a similar fashion,  when the user first sets a
        VRML file,  odds are they'll continue to set VRML files.

    d.  Think about the 3D file selector and how the text can be changed
        to be more helpful.  For example,  the text states that the
        units for offset is INCHES, but with IDF it may be inches or
        mm depending on whether the user selects MM or THOU units in
        the IDF board file.


4. IDF exporter:
	a. add ability to use VRML, STEP, and IGES models to create rough
		IDF outlines, but only at the user's request. The simplest
		technique would be to project points into the board's plane
		and calculate a rectangular bounding box; the height used
		shall be the maximum height; as per IDF specification, no
		negative offsets shall be allowed; the outline shall always
		begin at the board's surface.


5. STEP assembly output:
	a. create board
	b. add STEP and IGES models; if possible preserve color on STEP AP214

    STEP and IGES exporter: MUST be an export plugin (see below);
    rework all Export routines to integrate them in a better way
    as in the case of the IO_MGR. In fact it may be possible to
    extend the IO_MGR (but be extremely careful as this is a
    core class).

    IGES and STEP are probably best handled with individual
    enums: FILE3D_STEP and FILE3D_IGES. Rather than using
    Is3DType(),  use Get3DType() within a switch() block.

    If parts are colored, try to preserve the color for the sake
    of providing the MCAD user with some visual contrast. STEP
    assemblies look simply awful when imported into SolidWorks
    as a uniform gray.
    
    IGES: Will need to be implemented from scratch; it is a
    relatively simple CAD interchange specification but has
    been considered deprecated since about 2006. On the other
    hand it is likely that it will continue to be supported by
    all MCADs for quite a few years yet thanks to legacy
    support needs.
    
    STEP: OpenCascade is unsuitable since it puts all shapes
    at a single level and creates copies of every occurrence
    of a shape. This not only wastes vast amounts of memory
    but the resulting Assembly cannot be reasonably used within
    a CAD since shapes, parts, and subassemblies do not have the
    appropriate relationships.
    
    STEP support (AP203, AP203e2, AP214e3) shall be implented
    via the StepCode libraries (license: modified BSD)

6. Manage a Bill of Materials - this is a long-term project
    which must make use of a database. A Part Number 'fp_text'
    may be introduced to specify the part number in the module/
    schematic and used to look up other information in the
    database including:
        manufacturer part numbers (remember a 'part' may be
            an assembly consisting,  for example,  of a socket
            plus a chip)
        VRML models
        IDF models
        STEP/IGES models
        Link to documentation

Note: The BoM manager must be able to search for parts and
dump all required information (footprints, electrical symbol,
etc) into a local project directory. Information must also
be tracked via MD5 hashes to manage changes.





========================
     FINISHED ITEMS
========================

1. [DONE] [ Mitch from hackvana ]
	- wants a full-color graphical underlay to aid in migration from old
		or proprietary tools. In some cases scans or photos of old
		boards or printouts may be available but not the original
		CAD files or there may not be an importer for the CAD file.

	- option: use a vectorizer and feature recognition to convert to
		lines, filled zones, etc. This may be useful especially
		for multilayer boards. Mitch is not so keen on this option
		for 2 reasons: (1) there is no telling beforehand what
		a user might employ the underlay for, and (2) it will
		take a lot longer to code and test a vectorizer.

	NOTES:
	1. Easiest implementation consists of:
		+ modify bitmap tool to write object to 'Underlay' layer
                  rather than 'F.SilkS'. The underlay layer doesn't exist
                  of course, so the main pcbnew code must be touched to
                  reserve one of the technical layers.

		+ Modify pcbnew to:
			- reserve an 'Underlay' layer
			- render 'Underlay' before rendering anything else

		+ Modifications related to 'Underlay':
			- must never print
			- must never plot
